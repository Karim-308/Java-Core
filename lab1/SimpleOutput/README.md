## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).



Lab Exercise

Develop an application that extracts the minimum and maximum of the elements of an array of 1000 element and compute the search running time.

Rewrite the application to implement the binary search algorithm and compute the search running time.

Hint: Use System.currentTimeMillis() or System.nanoTime().



Create simple applications that performs the following actions:

Display a message to the command prompt.

Receives an input (as main arguments) and checks for its value and prints it back.

Receives two inputs (as main arguments) a number and a string and prints the string on different lines according to the given number.
